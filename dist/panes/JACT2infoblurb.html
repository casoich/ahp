    All our old friends, plus some new ones, are here in this marvelous musical adaptation! We'll meet the captivating Princess Snow White, the prince, the evil queen, and of course, the seven mischievous dwarfs Sarge, Gabby, Gloomy, Gus, Ticklish, Sprightly, Snore, and Slowpoke. There's a hilarious palace cat and an enchanted vixen&mdash;a fox, you could say&mdash;and a wonderful talking mirror. Following the traditional storyline, the fairy tale is brought to life with an eclectic score of toe-tapping tunes. A truly joyous play!
