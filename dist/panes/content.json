                "blurbtext": "<p><i>Always-Patsy Cline</i> is based on the true story of Patsy Cline’s friendship with Houston housewife <b>Louise Seger</b> who first heard Cline on “The Arthur Godfrey Show” and became an immediate fan.  Four years later Seger attended a performance, arriving early and met Cline who was just arriving and traveling alone. The two women struck up a friendship that resulted in Cline’s spending the night at Seger’s house.  Although they never met again, Cline wrote many letters and made many phone calls to her friend until her untimely death in a plane crash.  The play focuses on the fateful evening when Seger hears of Cline’s death.  She supplies a narrative while Patsy floats in and out singing the tunes that made her famous:  “Crazy,” “Always,“ “Have You Ever Been Lonely?”, “It Wasn’t God who made Honkey Tonk Angels,” “Leavin’ On Your Mind,”  “Seven Lonely Days,” in all 27 songs. Combining humor, sadness and reality, the show is family friendly and packed with great music.</p>",

                "blurbtext": "<p>In this delightful, laugh-a-minute comedy, four unique Southern women, all needing to escape the sameness of their day-to-day routines, are drawn together by Fate—and an impromptu happy hour—and decide it’s high time to reclaim the enthusiasm for life they’ve lost through the years. Randa, a perfectionist and workaholic, is struggling to cope with a surprise career derailment that, unfortunately, reveals that she has no life and no idea how to get one. Dot, still reeling from her husband’s recent demise and the loss of their plans for an idyllic retirement, faces the unsettling prospect of starting a new life from scratch—and all alone. Earthy and boisterous Marlafaye, a good ol’ Texas gal, has blasted into Savannah in the wake of losing her tom-cattin’ husband to a twenty-three-year-old dental hygienist. The strength of her desire to establish a new life is equaled only by her desire to wreak a righteous revenge on her ex. Also new to town, Jinx, a spunky ball of fire, offers her services as a much-needed life coach for these women. However, blinded by her determination and efforts to get their lives on track, she over-looks the fact that she’s the one most in need of sage advice. Over the course of six months, filled with laughter, hilarious misadventures, and the occasional liquid refreshment, these middle-aged women successfully bond and find the confidence to jumpstart their new lives. Together, they discover lasting friendships and a renewed determination to live in the moment—and most importantly, realize it’s never too late to make new old friends. So raise your glass to these strong Southern women and their fierce embrace of life and say “Cheers!” to this joyful and surprisingly touching Jones, Hope, Wooten comedy!</p>",

Anthony has spent his entire life on a cattle farm in rural Ireland, a state of affairs that—due to his painful shyness—suits him well. Rosemary lives right next door, determined to have him, watching the years slip away. With Anthony’s father threatening to disinherit him and a land feud simmering between their families, Rosemary has every reason to fear romantic catastrophe. But then, in this very Irish story with a surprising depth of poetic passion, these yearning, eccentric souls fight their way towards solid ground and some kind of happiness. Their journey is heartbreaking, funny as hell, and ultimately deeply moving. OUTSIDE MULLINGAR is a compassionate, delightful work about how it’s never too late to take a chance on love.</p>",

Its premiere production ran for months, playing to literally thousands of children, young and old. Hyronomous, an inept and lonely frog prince, lives in a bog in the kingdom of Spamelot. Hyronomous is bored and unhappy as a frog. He’s larger than the other frogs and hates the taste of flies. One day, the good witch Gloria appears to tell him he was once a human prince and it was a spell that turned him into an amphibian. To break this croak-filled wizardry, Hyronomous must be kissed by a maiden. In a hysterical scene, he learns how to walk like a human and sets off for the castle of Spamelot. He sets his sights on the spoiled and petulant Princess Gladiola. Gladiola is engaged to the painfully pompous Sir Lancelot Pancelot and he, of course, despises the frog at first sight. As Gladiola and Lancelot plot ways to get rid of Hyronomous, our green hero tries desperately to act like a human being. His attempt to act like a person at the dinner table turns into a hilarious scene... infuriating the princess. Luckily, he finds a friend in Delphinium, the handmaiden, and Aunt Queen Bea, who try to save him from the slings and arrows of the outrageous Gladiola. Our beloved frog finally gets his kiss from the handmaiden Delphinium, bringing about an ending full of wit and charm.</p>",

The irritated witch has her malicious henchmen, the Glumpwarts, terrorize Walt. In fear, he promises to give his firstborn child to the witch in exchange for his own freedom. Your audiences are then taken many years ahead to visit the beautiful Shwartzbuckle child... Rapunzel. (Now you know where the name comes from!) It’s our heroine’s 18th birthday, and Witch Izwitch follows through with her promise and places poor Rapunzel alone in a tower. From here, an exuberant, amusing rescue attempt begins! (As for the ’mane’ ingredient of the show, don’t worry! The famous ’hair climbing’ scene is a breeze to stage!) Can Prince Llewellyn persevere over the powers of evil? Will the fresh, hysterical characters (such as the sages Parsley, Rosemary and Thyme) be able to help? And can Rapunzel convince the witch that it’s okay to be unique? Filled with an abundant supply of delightful songs like ’Just Because You’re Different,’ ’I’m a Nut’ and, of course, ’Let Your Hair Down,’ this show is zestful entertainment!</p>",
