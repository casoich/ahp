            <p>Dear Patrons,</p>
            <p>Based on your response to last season’s questionnaire, I have selected a season of 6 plays and a musical revue to tickle your fancy. Your favorite actors are back! They will entertain you with titillating, romantic, farcical, mysterious, quirky, ironic, and madly impassioned stories of love, lust and golf!  Well folks, that is what makes the world go round. After this dizzying experience we wind down the 2015 season with a beautiful new play that is not a laugh out loud comedy. Instead, you will share a chuckle or two and most likely shed a tear witnessing this provocative and topical love story portrayed by three of your favorite actors.</p>
            <p>We’ve also reinstated the Johnny Appleseed schedule to include one Saturday performance. Thank you for your patronage, as well as sharing your thoughts with us.</p>
