Lions Club Talent Show

          <p>The Delmont Lions have been holding the annual talent show for over 50
years. We really love holding it at
Apple Hill, because it gives the contestants a real stage
experience.  One of the missions of Lions Club International is to
support and encourage youth. The talent show is one way we do that,
and the proceeds go to our scholarship fund and other local projects
that support youth, as well as sight and hearing impaired, diabetes
research, and the environment. We give three scholarships each year to
local students through our competitive Student of the Month program.
100% of the money that the Lions Club raises through the talent show
and other projects is donated.</p>
<h3 class="text-center">This event is free and open to the public. </h3>
