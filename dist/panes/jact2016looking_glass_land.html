    This wild adaptation retains some of <b>Lewis Carroll’s</b> deeper meanings, but what 
possesses it is a huge helping of unabashed silliness!  This delightful romp 
through Alice’s looking glass retains all of the familiar characters and introduces 
dozens of new ones sure to delight the young theatergoer.
