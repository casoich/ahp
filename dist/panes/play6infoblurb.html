Ludwig’s farce takes audiences on a hilarious romp which pulls the rug out from under the stuffy denizens of a private county club.  Filled with mistaken identities, slamming doors, and over-the-top romantic shenanigans, it’s a furiously paced farce that recalls the Marx brothers.  A charmingly madcap adventure about love, life, and man’s eternal love affair with…..GOLF!
