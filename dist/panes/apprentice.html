                    From May through August, Apple Hill Playhouse gives a small, select group of young people a chance to learn theater techniques in a hands-on professional setting. There can be up to four apprentices each summer.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Our summer season includes adult productions, Johnny Appleseed Children's Theater productions, and a children's mainstage
                    production. This schedule can be challenging and is a real world example of what these young people will actually experience as adult artists. Apprentices will train in any or all of the following areas:
                    <ul>
                        <li>
                            <b>SET BUILDING</b> - Learn how a set goes from concept to stage under the guidance of our scenic designer and crew.
                        </li>
                        <li> <b>PROPERTIES</b> - Learn about the selection and acquisition of stage properties and their organization during a show.
                        </li>
                        <li> <b>COSTUME CONSTRUCTION</b> - Learn how costumes are chosen, constructed and altered by working along with the Costume Coordinator. Learn how costumes are maintained, cleaned and stored during a show.
                        </li>
                        <li> <b>STAGE CREW</b> - Learn how the actors on stage depend on the crew backstage by assisting with running lights, changing sets and props, and following cue sheets.
                        </li>
                        <li> <b>FACILITIES MANAGEMENT</b> - Learn how "the little things matter" by helping in the upkeep of theater buildings and grounds, assisting with house management and snack bar.
                        </li>
                        <li> <b>STAGE MANAGING</b> - Apprentices are sometimes selected to serve as stage manager for an entire Johnny Appleseed Children's Theater Production.
                        </li>
                    </ul>
                </p>
                <p>
                    All apprenticeship assignments will be made by the Apprenticeship Coordinator who will supervise and organize all activities.
                </p>
                <p>
                    An average of 30 hours per week will be assigned each apprentice. Specific days and hours will be assigned. No late evening
                    assignments. Any hours missed must be made up before stipend is paid.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The apprenticeship Program will run May through August. Apprentices serving the entire term will receive a stipend of three hundred dollars based on quality and quantity of service and completion of 300 hours maximum.
                </p>
