            <h3>USHERS</h3><br/>

            The perfect way to start to get involved with Apple Hill Playhouse!  Ushering involves minimal time commitment and you get to see the show for free!  Ushers are needed at every single performance to assist our patrons with finding their proper seats.  We ask that ushers arrive approximately one hour prior to performances.  You may be asked to fold programs prior to the house opening, at which time you show patrons to their seats.  Once the show has started, you are free to find a free seat in the theatre and enjoy the show!  If you're interested in becoming an Apple Hill usher, you can e-mail <a href="mailto:boxoffice@applehillplayhouse.org?subject=2015 Usher request" >here</a> or call 724-468-5050, and tell the box office you'd like to become an usher.  We look forward to getting to know you!
