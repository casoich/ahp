            <p><em>Apple Hill Playhouse is home of Orchard Performing Arts Company, Inc. (OPAC).</em> </p>
<p>We are a non-profit (501c3) organization who's mission is "to preserve and 
advance the traditions of live theatre, through entertainment and education. Our 
goal is to foster public interest in and awareness of the performing arts, 
thereby developing a contingent of knowledgeable theatre patrons. It seeks to 
serve persons of all ages, in the Tri-State area, by continuing to strive for 
excellence in all endeavors." </p>
<p>Our mission's success depends on the generosity of 
our patrons.  The revenue we generate from ticket sales is only a part of what 
we need to continue the quality entertainment and education Apple Hill Playhouse 
is known for.  Your tax deductible gifts and grants are key to our existence and 
viability. Thank you for your support, patronage, and generosity.</p>
