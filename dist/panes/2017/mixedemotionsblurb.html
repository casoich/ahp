    A gentle, yet hilarious comedy full of winsome wit and humanity about a sixty-five 
    year old widower’s courtship of a sixty-one year old woman.  As Christine (an 
    interior decorator and lapsed Catholic) prepares to move from her New York apartment 
    to live with another widow in Florida,  Herman (A Jewish carpet dealer) appears 
    and requests that she stay in the city and marry him. When their respective 
    mates were alive they saw each other constantly and frequently traveled together.  
    Christine thinks the idea is ridiculous but Herman persists in his quest amid 
    the turmoil of moving men Ralph and Clark’s emptying Christine’s home.
