    <i>Always-Patsy Cline</i> is based on the true story of Patsy Cline’s friendship 
    with Houston housewife Louise Seger who first heard Cline on “The Arthur Godfrey 
    Show” and became an immediate fan.  Four years later Seger attended a performance, 
    arriving early and met Cline who was just arriving and travelling alone.  The 
    two women struck up a friendship that resulted in Cline’s spending the night 
    at Seger’s house.  Although they never met again, Cline wrote many letters and 
    made many phone calls to her friend until her untimely death in a plane crash.  
    The play focuses on the fateful evening when Seger hears of Cline’s death.  
    She supplies a narrative while Patsy floats in and out singing the tunes that 
    made her famous:  “Crazy,” “Always, “ “Have You Ever Been Lonely?”, “It wasn’t 
    God who made Honkey Tonk Angels,” “Leavin’ On Your Mind,”  “Seven Lonely Days,” i
    n all 27 songs.  Combining humor, sadness and reality, the show is family friendly 
    and packed with great music.
