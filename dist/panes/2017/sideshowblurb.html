Dramatically based upon real-life vaudeville entertainers and conjoined twins Daisy and Violet Hilton, SIDE SHOW follows
these unique sisters from their humble beginnings among the "freaks" of the sideshow, to their rise of fame in the Vaudeville
circuit and eventually, Hollywood. Along the way they face challenges of love, identity, acceptance, privacy, discrimination,
isolation, and persecution. This captivating story (with book &amp; lyrics by Bill Russell and music by Henry Krieger) explores
the differences that join us all together and tear us apart as well as touching upon the instinctive fears in all of us,
and asks the question, "Who will love me as I am?" </p>
    <p>SIDE SHOW is presented by special arrangement with Samuel French, Inc.</p>
