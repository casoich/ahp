                    <h3>A message to our patrons</h3>
                    <p>This year we are producing fewer plays in both the Main Stage and the Johnny Appleseed Children's Theatre and have added
a Family Show to the Main Stage season. <i>Seussical</i> will provide opportunities for actors to matriculate from Johnny Appleseed Children's Theatre to Main
Stage where they will share the stage with seasoned players. In the past we have played both JACT and the adult plays on the
same stage with a traveler curtain dividing them. By eliminating the need to shift and store furniture and props we will
have the time to focus on the production values of all our plays. The directors, designers, stage managers, cast and run crew
welcome this change and we hope that you will too.</p>
