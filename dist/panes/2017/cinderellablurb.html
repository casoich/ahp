    Netzelâ€™s outstanding dramatization has all the ingredients that have made the story a perennial favorite:
</p>
<p>
Dirty, ragged, pitiful but optimistic and loving Cinderella; her cruel stepmother 
and stepsisters; the ball and the handsome prince looking for a bride; the fairy 
godmother; the glass slipper and the search for the foot that fits it, and the happily-ever-after 
ending. This Cinderella is a real person with the hopes and petulance and frustration 
and love that modern young folk experience when their fantasies seem to be impossible 
dreams.
