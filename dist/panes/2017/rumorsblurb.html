    At a large, tastefully appointed Sneden’s Landing townhouse, the Deputy Mayor 
    has just shot himself.  Though only a flesh wound, four couples are about to 
    experience a severe attack of Farce.  Gathering for their tenth wedding anniversary, 
    the host lies bleeding in the other room while his wife is nowhere in sight.  
    His lawyer, Ken and wife Chris must get “the story” straight before the other 
    guests arrive.  As the confusions and miscommunications mount, the evening spins 
    off into classic farcical hilarity. <i>“Has nothing on its mind except making the 
        audience laugh.”</i></p>
