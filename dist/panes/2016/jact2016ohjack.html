    Take an old tale and give it to Kinter and it turns into magic!<br/>
A kid at heart, Mr. Kinter provides not one, but two of the funniest chases ever 
in this version of Jack and the Beanstalk.  Using the classic melodrama style, 
the play features all of the regular Jack characters and adds <i>Vernon Q Bile</i>, the  
vilest landlord of them all.    Feel free to hiss!
