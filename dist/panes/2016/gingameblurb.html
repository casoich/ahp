    Visiting day at a shabby run down nursing home finds Fonsia Dorsey and Weller Martin with no visitors, so they seek asylum on the porch where Weller teaches Fonsia to play gin.  When the student always wins, the teacherâ€™s temper is inflamed.  Writer D. L. Coburn uses quick, humorous and relatable dialog to allow the duo to reveal intimate details about their pasts.  <i>Chip Kerr and Shirley Ratner, directed by Wayne Brinda,</i> perform "A fiercely funny yet vibrant study on loneliness, disillusion, and old age."
