    Inspector Prattâ€™s record of crime detection at Bagshot House, chronicled previously 
    in <i>MURDERED TO DEATH</i> and <i>SECONDARY CAUSE OF DEATH</i> has a disastrously high body 
    count. Back again, he meets the new owner of the house, Nancy Allwright, and 
    soon he is embroiled in more mystery, aided and abetted by Miss Maple, Constable 
    Thompkins, Upper crust Ginny, and Italian gigolo Enzo. Chaos and danger loom 
    with the arrival of Welsh busybody Blodwyn Morgan. If you love to guess "who 
    dun it," this play is for you. Sherlock, step aside! <i>Rick Dutrow directs and 
    reprises his role as Inspector Pratt</i>.
