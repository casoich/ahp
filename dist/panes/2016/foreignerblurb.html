Froggy LeSeuer, a British demolition expert who runs training sessions at a nearby army base has brought a friend to a rural Georgia fishing lodge.  Charlie is pathologically shy and overcome with fear at the thought of making conversation with strangers.  Before he leaves, Froggy tells his hosts that Charlie is from an exotic foreign country and speaks no English.  Left alone, Charlie is privy to the evil plans of a sinister two-faced minister and his redneck associates.  Audiences will laugh themselves silly with Shueâ€™s positively antic plot.
