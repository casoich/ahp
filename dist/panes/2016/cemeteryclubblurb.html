    Sometimes called "the Jewish <i>Steel Magnolias</i>," three Jewish widows meet for 
    tea monthly before visiting their husband’s graves. Feisty Lucille wants to 
    have fun; sweet tempered Ida wants to begin a new life; Doris is judgmental  
    and priggish. A chance meeting with Sam, a butcher visiting his wife’s grave, 
    begins a new adventure for Ida. When the three widows, dressed in full 
    bridesmaid’s regalia, serve as bridesmaids for a mutual friend’s fourth 
    marriage, they secure a cookie supply and celebrate at Ida’s place. Their 
    friendship is challenged when Lucille and Doris admit their attempt to squash 
    Ida’s budding relationship with Sam. Very touching and humorous.
