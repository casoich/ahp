                    Apple Hill Playhouse will premiere a seated reading of a stage adaptation of The Breakfast Club, written by local director/playwright, Rob MacIntyre, as the first of AHP's Speakers' Series talks. After the reading, there will be a chance to discuss the work, and ask questions to the author.

Admission is a voluntary donation. Give what you feel this type of event is worth to you!

Note: the script follows along with the movie, and as such has adult-themed language.
