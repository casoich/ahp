The king and queen of Never Nod have a new baby, Princess Briar Rose.  The witch 
Evilina, who lives with a giant spider, sets a terrible curse on the poor  young 
princess.  Sixteen years later, itâ€™s up to Prince Alexander to come to the rescue 
of Briar Rose and the court... for they are all asleep.  The prince must fight 
a Wall of Thorns, a False Princess, and the frightening Dark Knight. A beautiful 
score adds charm to the classic show.
