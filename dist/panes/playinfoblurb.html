    It’s 1942, and two of Hollywood’s biggest divas have descended upon the luxurious Palm Beach Royale Hotel – assistants, luggage and legendary feud with one another in tow. Everything seems to be in order for their wartime performance, that is until they are somehow assigned to the same suite. Mistaken Identities, overblown egos, double entendres, and a love note to the classic farces of the 30s and 40s.
