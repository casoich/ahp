    A 1960’s French farce for the English-speaking stage which features a self-styled 
    Parisian lothario Bernard, who has Italian, German, and American fiances, each 
    a beautiful airline hostess with frequent “layovers.”  Bernard keeps “ one up, 
    one down, and one pending” until unexpected schedule changes bring all three 
    to Paris and Bernard’s apartment at the same time.  “Fasten your seatbelts 
    for the most deliciously funny flight of your life.”  Winner 2008 Tony Award.
    <br/>Mild adult themes.
