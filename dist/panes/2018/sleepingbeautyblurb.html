The emphasis is on comedy in this musical adaptation of the classic fairy tale. Young audiences will find a delightful group of characters as enchanting as the magic in the story itself. There’s <b>Chester the Jester</b>, <b>Typsy the Gypsy</b>, and the <b>Royal Magician</b>, who is so inept he transforms himself into a frog! And there’s the evil <b>Thornberry</b>, who puts the curse on <b>Princess Elaine</b> (the ’sleeping beauty’), and the brave <b>Prince Dauntless</b>, who battles the fire-breathing dragon to break the magic spell. Rich with music underscoring, themes, and five tuneful songs, <i>Sleeping Beauty</i> is a hit with kids!
