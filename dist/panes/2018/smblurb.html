<p> This popular musical (rights pending) bring back memories of class of 1959: duck-tailed, hot-rodding boys and their gum-snapping, hip-shaking girls in bobby sox and pedal pushers, evoking the look and sound of the 1950s in this rollicking musical. Head of the gang and the new (good) girl try to relive the high romance of their previous summer as the rest of the gang sings and dances its way through songs recalling the music of Buddy Holly, Little Richard, and Elvis Presley that became the soundtrack of a generation.
