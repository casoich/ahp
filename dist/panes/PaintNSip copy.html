            Apple Hill Playhouse is hosting a paint and sip fundraiser on Saturday, July 23 
            in our beautiful orchard. One event is planned for adults and one for kids. 
            Invite a friend and enjoy an evening of step-by-step instructions to create a one-
            of-a-kind creation with local visual artist, Micaela Cottman of DLG Tattoo while 
            sipping on a beverage. Michelaâ€™s work consists mainly of illustrative color with 
            organic subject matter.
