Joe is excited to be performing for the first time at <b>Apple Hill</b>. After a long break from the stage he first dipped his toe again with <b>Theatre Factory</b> as an Assistant Stage Manager, followed up shortly thereafter as “Stage Manager” in <i>It’s a Wonderful Life: A Live Radio Play</i> with <b>Mon River Arts</b> and had a great time as Tim the Stage Manager in <i>Noises Off!</i> for <b>Old Schoolhouse Players</b> in Hickory. Thanks go to Stephen for helping him finally break the Stage Manager streak! Many thanks to the cast and crew for all their hard work and silliness, making every night a blast! Finally, Joe would like to thank his wife, Andrea, for her constant love, support, and tolerance!. </p>
