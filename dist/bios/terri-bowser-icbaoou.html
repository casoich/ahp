    <p >After being away from the stage for 8 years while pursuing two nursing degrees, this season has been a busy and exciting one for me. It's been so much fun working with old friends (Rick Dutrow) and meeting new (very talented) ones (Craig, Matt, Pam and Angie). My last performance was playing Mrs. Baker in <i>Butterflies are Free</i> which opened this season at <b>Apple Hill</b>. Other credits of <b>Apple Hill</b> <b>Playhouse</b> performances include <i>Dearly Beloved</i>, <i>One Flew over the Cuckooâ€™s Nest</i>, <i>The Boys Next Door</i>, and <i>Red Herring</i>. Other local credits include Kidworks, main stage and musicals at <b>The Theatre Factory</b>; and performances at <b>Greensburg Garden and Civic Center</b>; industrial films, and commercials for TV and radio. I want to send my love and thanks always to my Mom and Dad for their love and encouragement, my husband Robert for his patience and support of all my endeavors, and all my family and friends who come out to the shows. </p>
