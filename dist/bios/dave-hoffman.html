    Dave Hoffman has crawled out of his cave and is returning to the stage this year after a ten plus year self imposed hibernation. One of his greatest accomplishments at the beginning of his “career” was auditioning and being enrolled at the prestigious <b>American Academy of Dramatic Arts</b> in New York City where he studies his craft for one year and was politely not invited to return for a second year. Previously he has directed and appeared on stages around the Pittsburgh area in an assortment of comedic plays and roles. He is very pleased to be making his first appearance on the <b>Apple Hill Playhouse</b> stage as well as reuniting with fellow actors/director Rick, Kristin and Ron.
