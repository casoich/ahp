is so excited to be a part of <i>Fox!</i> Some of his favorite AHP roles are Henry (<i>Funny Money</i>), Bellhop (<i>Lend Me a Tenor</i>), Bassinet (<i>The Ladies Man</i>). He has been heavily involved in community theatre for the past 9 years and sits on the Greensburg Civic Board. He has had a blast working with his friends on this show and can’t think of a better way to spend two months! “Thank you, Ron, not only for this opportunity, but for many over the years. Sue, you are a fantastic Stage Manager. Cast mates, you made this a truly enjoyable experience. Special thanks to my family (especially my father), my friends, and most of all……YOU!”
