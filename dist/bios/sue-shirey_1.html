    Susan is pleased to be back at <b>Apple Hill</b> working with Matt (once again) and this talented cast. She currently serves on the <b>New Kensington Civic Theatre</b> board of directors as props chair and has worked with local theaters (in the pit, on stage and behind) including NKCT, <b>Penn State New Ken Forum Theatre</b>, <b>Apple Hill Playhouse</b> and <b>New Works</b>. Her past favorite performance on stage was as  Eulalie in <i>The Music Man</i> and her favorite backstage experiences were as the stage manager for <i>Who's Afraid of Virginia Woolf</i> and <i>Leading Ladies</i>. Susan is an account coordinator with Zoll LifeVest for the five New York boroughs. She would like to thank the cast and crew for being so much fun to work with, and to Derek, Reed and Rose (making her debut this Fall) for being her joy.
