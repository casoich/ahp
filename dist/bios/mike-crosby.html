    Mike is absolutely thrilled to be apart of <i>Funny Money</i> and to return to the <b>Apple Hill Playhouse</b> stage after a one year absence! This will be Mike's 8th season of performing at <b>Apple Hill</b> and some his favorite roles here include Norman in <i>The Star Spangled Girl</i>, Detective Baxter in <i>Busybody</i>, the Bellhop in <i>Lend Me a Tenor</i>, and Bassinet in <i>The Ladies Man</i>. Other favorite roles include Gary/Roger in <i>Noises Off</i> and Scott in <i>Evil Dead the Musical</i>. Mike has been heavily involved in community theater for the past 9 years and is the Vice President of <b>Greensburg Civic Theatre</b> (check us out at <a href="http://www.gctheatre.org" target="_blank">www.gctheatre.org</a>). <i>Funny Money</i> has given Mike the opportunity to work with his friends old and new and he couldn't be happier. <i>"I get to work with people that I love working with, and with people I've always wanted to work with. What could be better?"</i> Mike would like to thank Matt for being a wonderful director and giving him this great opportunity, to Sue for being fantastic in a hard and thankless job, and to his ridiculously talented cast for being awesome. <i>"Special thanks to my family (especially my father), to Rachel for being a good friend and helping me with my lines over and over again, my friends, and most of all...YOU!"</i>
