     .. most recently played Mr. Van Daan in the Trafford <b>Theater Factoryâ€™s</b> production of <i>The Diary of Anne Frank</i>, but Andrew is no stranger to the <b>Apple Hill</b> barnyard. Over the years you may have seen him in the dual role of Colonel Charles Craddock/Cardew Longfellow in <i>Secondary Cause of Death</i> , Sal in <i>A Little Family Business</i> or Dub Dubberly In <i>Dearly Beloved</i> which he reprised in its sequel <i>Christmas Belles</i>. He is ecstatic to be working with so many talented old and new friends.
