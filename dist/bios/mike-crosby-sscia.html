...is thrilled to be a part of <i>Sin, Sex, and the CIA</i> and is thankful to be involved in a production that pairs him with old and new friends. Mike has been heavily involved in the theatre community for the past 9 years having appeared in over 50 productions and working behind the scenes on almost as many. Favorite roles include Gary/Roger in <i>Noises Off</i>, Robert in <i>Don’t Dress For Dinner</i>, Scott in <i>Evil Dead: The Musical</i>, and The Bellhop in <i>Lend Me a Tenor</i>. Mike would like to thank the King of Farce (aka Ron Ferrara) for another amazing opportunity, Sue who is the best Stage Manager in the business, the amazing cast, and the awesome crew at AHP for their hard work on this production. Special thanks to his family (especially his father), friends, and most of all…YOU!
