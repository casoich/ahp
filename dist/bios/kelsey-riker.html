    Kelsey Riker is very excited to be making her <b>Apple Hill Playhouse</b> debut in <i>The World Goes ‘Round</i>.  Riker is a senior at <b>Seton Hill University</b> pursuing a Bachelor of Fine Arts in Musical Theatre.  In recent years, she has been seen working on stage and backstage on several student and mainstage productions at Seton Hill, teaching drama with the Seton Arts Service Corps, choreographing at <b>Steel River Playhouse</b> and Seton Hill, and pouring coffee in a cardboard cup at Dunkin’ Donuts.  Love and thanks to MAD, her SHU family, Denise, and this crazy talented cast and crew for the support and the fun and hard work it took to put this beautiful piece on stage!
