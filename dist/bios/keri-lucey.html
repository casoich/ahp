    <p>Keri Lucey is thrilled to be joining the cast of <i>The World Goes Round</i>. Originally from New York where she taught high school English for twelve years, Keri moved to Murrysville last year with her husband, Derrick, son, Ty, and daughter, Kya.  The newest addition to their family is a nine month old French Mastiff puppy named Lu Lu Belle.  She is Keri’s absolute sweetheart!! She now works as a bookseller at Barnes and Noble in Monroeville. It is her dream job. Keri’s last community theater role was Sister Mary Leo in <i>Nunsense</i> and prior to that she played Hope Harcourt in <i>Anything Goes</i>.  She has been a cantor in church, a wedding and funeral vocalist, and a flutist for the past twenty years. She was the lead singer of the band <b>Sin Wagon</b>, for the past two years in New York and sang songs that spanned the decades from the twenties to today.</p>   
    <p>Keri has tried her hand at directing as well and loved it! She directed a wonderful cast of high school students at Kenmore West High School in Kenmore, NY in <i>The Wizard of Oz</i> in 2006 and another great cast of UPK-12 students at Brushton-Moira Central School in <i>Anything Goes</i> in 2010.  Teaching and working with kids makes her very happy and she loves seeing how much they grow in confidence during a production.</p>
    <p>Keri taught Theatre I as an elective to high school students for ten years and her favorite topics were stage combat, improvisation, and theater games.  Making people laugh is by far one of her favorite things to do and she welcomes the chance to do that through song whenever possible. She has loved working with the incredibly talented cast and directors of this show and she is very grateful to have been selected for a role.  She would like to thank her husband and kids for their understanding and patience during her busy rehearsal schedule and her parents for driving 9 hours to see her perform!</p>
