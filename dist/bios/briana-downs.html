    Briana is thrilled to be back on the <b>Apple Hill</b> stage and sharing it with such a great cast and crew! Briana was last seen as Athena Sinclair in <i>Suite Surrender</i>. She has been performing for over 20 years in community theatre and has directed and performed with The <b>Pittsburgh New Works Festival</b> and still keeps coming back for more! Some favorite roles are, Suzette in <i>Don't Dress for Dinner</i>, Louise in <i>The Underpants</i>, 2nd Witch/Weird Sister in <i>Macbeth</i>, Maggie Saunders in <i>Lend Me a Tenor</i>, Janet Weiss in <i>The Rocky Horror Show</i>, and Charlotte in <i>Charlotte's Web</i>. When Briana isn't performing she is slamming coffee as the Marketing/Leasing Director for Monroeville Apartments and is the Kidworks Coordinator at <b>The Theatre Factory</b> all while giving Ginger and Kiki some massive love and appreciation! Thank goodness for the support of family, friends, and patrons like you!
