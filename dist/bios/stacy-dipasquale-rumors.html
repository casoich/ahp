This is Stacy’s first show at <b>Apple Hill</b> and she is beyond thrilled to be working with such a talented and funny cast. She was previously seen in <i>It’s a Wonderful Life</i> at <b>Mon River Arts</b> and <i>Anne Frank</i> at the <b>Geyer Performing Arts Center</b>. Thanks to everyone involved for making this another memorable theatre experience.</p>
