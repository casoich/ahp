Rick thoroughly enjoyed directing himself and his cast last season in <b>Apple Hill Playhouse's</b> 2016 production of <i>Death By Fatal Murder</i> and he's back again! Rick would like to thank his incredibly talented cast, crew, and production staff! He also wants to give a special thanks to his stage manager Stephanie Swift; Rick's admiration for Stephanie is such that he asked Stephanie to permanently play the part of His Wife and she accepted the role!!! Rick &amp; Stephanie, congratulations on your Engagement!!! Rick would like to thank you the audience who make this all worthwhile! Thank you, thank you, thank you! "Please continue to support the arts and Apple Hill Playhouse and please enjoy the show!"
