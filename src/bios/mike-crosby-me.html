Mike is thrilled to be a part of <i>Mixed Emotions</i> and is honored to be involved in a production that reunites him with Chip and Shirley. It has been over a decade since Mike has been on stage with Chip and 6 years since he has been on stage with Shirley. Mike has been heavily involved in the theatre community for the past 11 years having appeared in over 60 productions and working behind the scenes on almost as many. Favorite roles include Gary/Roger in <i>Noises Off</i>, Robert in <i>Don't Dress For Dinner</i>, Scott in <i>Evil Dead: The Musical</i>, and The Bellhop in <i>Lend Me a Tenor</i>. Mike would like to thank Rick for an amazing opportunity, Stephanie, Mitch, Pat, Tina, and the amazing staff at <b>Apple Hill Playhouse</b> for working so hard to keep community theatre alive. Special thanks to his family (especially his father), friends, and most of allâ€¦ <b>YOU</b>!
