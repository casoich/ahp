    Until this summer Pamela had not acted since college. This season she has performed in two JACT productions, first as a townsperson in <i>The Invisible Dragon</i> and then as the queen in <i>Snow White</i>. She would like to thank her children Ethan and Ben Lee, for being cool enough dudes to enjoy hanging out at the theatre all summer. Pamela would also like to give a huge thank you to the entire <b>Apple Hill</b> team for all their support and encouragement.
