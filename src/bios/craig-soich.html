<div>Craig is excited to return to the stage this season at <b>Apple Hill Playhouse</b>! 
    In addition to serving on the board of <b>AHP</b>, he is also active with <b>Valley Players of Ligonier</b> and 
    <b>Greensburg Civic Theatre</b>. Last season at <b>Apple Hill Playhouse</b>, 
    he portrayed Bernard S. Dunlap in <i>Suite Surrender</i>, and Count Puchlik of 
    Puszczykowo in <i>Secondary Cause of Death</i>, and has just finished playing Freddie in <i>Noises Off</i> in Ligonier.
    Thanks go to all his castmates for accepting him late into the fold, so to speak.
    He dedicates whatever happens onstage to his children Alec, Kaley, Camden, and 
    Avery, as well as the rest of his crazy-sideways-extended family.
