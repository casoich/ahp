Shirley had no "mixed emotions when it came to performing in this play! She gets to eat chocolate through out and perform with the talented Chip Kerr; her favorite and long-time acting partner (this is their 14th collaboration)! They first appeared together in <i>A Life's Work</i> and <i>The Lost Second</i>, two one-acts by John Carosella, presented under the name <i>Threefer</i> at Pitt-Greensburg. Last year, they were together in <i>The Gin Game</i>. Previous pairings were <i>On Golden Pond</i>, <i>The Last Romance</i>, <i>Be My Baby</i>, and <i>Squabbles</i>. In addition, she is happy that Dan Krack is choreographing this show (he is her wonderful acting/dance partner from <i>6 Dance Lessons in 6 Weeks</i>.) Other favorite shows include last years <i>The Cemetery Club</i>, <i>The Odd Couple, Female Version</i>, <i>The Prime of Miss Jean Brodie</i>, <i>Broadway Bound</i>, and <i>The Effects of Gamma Rays on man-in-the-Moon Marigolds</i>. She has also performed with <b>Little Lake Theatre</b>, <b>St. Vincent Summer Theatre</b>, <b>City Theatre</b>, and <b>Greensburg Civic Theatre</b>. It's nice to be back with friends, Mike Crosby and Rick Dutrow, and working for the first time with Mitch and Stephanie. Thank you to Pat and Marge for the gift of working on this stage; to my husband, Herb, for his encouragement and support; to my daughter, Melinda, who encourages me from Los Angeles, and to my son, Herb, who has come from Los Angeles to be here for me. Thank you to the rest of my dear family and friends for their presence and support.
