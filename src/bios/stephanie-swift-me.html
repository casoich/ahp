Stephanie has enjoyed watching this play develop into a wonderful romantic comedy and working alongside her "brand new" fiancé, Rick Dutrow. Chip, Shirley, Mike and Mitch have made this a worthwhile experience and have made her second time stage managing a breeze. She previously stage managed 2015's <i>Outgoing Tide</i> and she assistant-directed and portrayed Blodwyn Morgan in last season's <i>Death by Fatal Murder</i>. She also appeared last year in <i>Sin, Sex and the CIA</i> as Ranger Don/Donna Yarid. Previous favorite roles include Sister Mary Leo in <i>Nunsense</i> with <i>APA</i>, Peggy in <i>Polyester! The Musical</i> at <b>The Theatre Factory</b>, The General in <i>Guys and Dolls</i> at <b>McKeesport Little Theatre</b>, Dorothy in <i>The Wiz</i> at <b>Butler Summer Dramatics</b>, and Pontius Pilate in <i>Jesus Christ Superstar</i> at <b>Chatham College</b>. She also portrayed Mary Hatch in <i>It’s a Wonderful Life, The Radio Play</i> and Louise in <i>Private Lives</i> at <b>The Theatre Factory</b>, Special thanks to Pat, Rick, Marge, the Apple Hill folks and the Lord who is "up there" with Miriam and Moe and too many loved ones to list!
