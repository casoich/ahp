    <p>D Palyo is thrilled to be performing in his first show here at the <b>Apple Hill Playhouse</b>. Most recently D played Fred Casley in <i>Chicago</i> and the King in <i>O'Sullivan Stew</i> at the <b>The Theatre Factory</b>. D truly enjoys all aspects of theatre. When not on stage D can be found backstage doing makeup, stage managing, directing, and everything in between. He would like to thank Thom, Mike, and the entire cast for all their hard work in bringing this beautiful story to life. Lastly he would like to thank his family for all their love and support allowing him to indulge himself in his love of theatre.Â </p>
