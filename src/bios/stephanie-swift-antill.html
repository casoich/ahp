    is thrilled to embark on her first stage managing effort. A talented cast and staff have made this transition very easy and making the play come alive has been a treat to watch. Recent stage credits include Sister Mary Leo (<i>Nunsense</i>) with APA, Queen Mother (<i>O’Sullivan Stew</i>) and Mary Hatch (<i>It’s a Wonderful Life the Radio Play</i>) with <b>Theatre Factory</b>. Thank you to family, husband, Bernard (the chihuahua) for their love and support.
