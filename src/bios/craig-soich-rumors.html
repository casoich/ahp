Craig has been doing shows with <b>Apple Hill Playhouse</b> since <i>Mrs. Bob Cratchit’s Wild Christmas Binge</i> in 2012. Since then, he has joined the board of Apple Hill (and currently sits as board president) and has had roles of varying consequence with them. By far his favorite role with AHP was playing Bernard Dunlap in <i>Suite Surrender</i>, along with Alex, Stephen, and Rachel. Other favorite roles were Bernard in <i>Don’t Dress for Dinner</i> at <b>Greensburg Civic Theatre</b>, and Freddy in <i>Noises Off</i> at <b>Valley Players of Ligonier</b>. As always, Craig dedicates whatever happens on stage to his children, Alec, Kaley, Camden, and Avery.
