<div>Craig is excited to return to the stage this season at <b>Apple Hill Playhouse</b>! 
    In addition to serving on the board of <b>AHP</b>, he is also active with <b>Valley Players of Ligonier</b> and 
    <b>Greensburg Civic Theatre</b>. Last season at <b>Apple Hill Playhouse</b>, 
    he portrayed Bernard S. Dunlap in <i>Suite Surrender</i>, and Count Puchlik of 
    Puszczykowo in <i>Secondary Cause of Death</i>. This season at Apple Hill he played Ralph in <i>Butterflies Are Free</i>, and before that he was Freddie in <i>Noises Off</i> in Ligonier.
    Thanks go to all his castmates, especially Pam, who helped with his British dialect immensely!
    He dedicates whatever happens onstage to his children Alec, Kaley, Camden, and Avery.
