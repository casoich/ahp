Mike is thrilled to be a part of <i>Rumors</i> and is having a blast being in a show with so many old friends while making new ones. Mike has been heavily involved in the theatre community for the past 11 years having appeared in over 60 productions and working behind the scenes on almost as many. Favorite roles include Gary/Roger in <i>Noises Off</i>, Robert in <i>Don’t Dress For Dinner</i>, Scott in <i>Evil Dead: The Musical</i>, and The Bellhop in <i>Lend Me a Tenor</i>. Mike would like to thank Stephen, Ellen, and the cast for making this such an enjoyable experience as well as the amazing staff at <b>Apple Hill Playhouse</b> for working so hard to keep community theatre alive. Special thanks to his family (especially his father), friends, and most of all…YOU!
