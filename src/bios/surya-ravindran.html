    Surya Ravindran is thrilled to be in his first Pittsburgh-area performance in <i>The World Goes 'Round</i>. Favorite past roles include Rod (<i>Avenue Q</i>), Chip (<i>The 25th Annual Putnam County Spelling Bee</i>), Hanschen (<i>Spring Awakening</i>), and Dr. Madden/Dr. Fine (<i>Next to Normal</i>). Surya holds a BSE in Biomedical Engineering from Case Western Reserve University, and works a real-person job as an Engineer at Zoll LiveVest. Other hobbies include Taco Bell, Pizza, bad puns, and pretending to be an adult by handing out business cards. He also has a wonderful talent where he can fall asleep with his eyes open, which he will demonstrate in a scene during this show. If you can guess the scene, he will buy you dinner. Surya thanks everyone involved in the show for their dedication and talent, and his family and friends for their constant support despite the fact that they probably haven't seen him for several months.
