    After an eight year hiatus to pursue two nursing degrees, I am so excited to be back on the stage playing Mrs. Baker. This is a phenomenal cast to be working with; Matt and Klase are such impressive actors, as well as Craig and Karin our director who has helped us nurture these characters. My last performance was playing Frankie Futrell in <i>Dearly Beloved</i>, here at <b>Apple Hill</b>; other shows I am proud to add to my list of performances at <b>Apple Hill</b> are <i>One Flew over the Cuckoo’s Nest</i>, <i>The Boys Next Door</i>, and <i>Red Herring</i>. I will also be playing the part of Jocelyn in this season’s fourth show <i>It Could be Any One of Us</i>. You may even catch a glimpse of me on TV in several Molyneaux commercials the coming months. I want to send my love and thanks to my Mom and Dad for their encouragement and always “being there” for me, my husband Robert for supporting (and tolerating) all my endeavors, and all my family and friends who come out to the shows. (…and John, I miss you running lines with me!!!)
