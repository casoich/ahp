    At age five, Mike Marra starred as the Candy Man in a kindergarten choir concert at Glade View elementary school, now a condominium in Lower Burrell. "The essence of my role was to pass out candy, a swirled taffy," he recalls. "My mom and grandma were sitting way in the back, but the song ended, and I had not yet reached them. So I just kept passing out taffy until I did, to the applause and laughter of the crowd. I got a great big kiss, too." Since then, Mike has been largely typecast in similar roles. When he's not designing sound or scenery, stage managing, building sets, or acting for <b>Apple Hill</b>, Mike can usually be found in the parking lot throwing a boomerang or contemplating divine mysteries.
