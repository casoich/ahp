    <p>“It’s called experience,” says Maud. And what a wonderful experience it is to be paired with the talented Chip Kerr for the tenth time, a coupling which began with John Carosella’s one-act, <i>A Life’s Work</i>. She is very happy to work again with the versatile Matt Mlynarski and for the first time with director Thom McLaughlin. Shirley has appeared in over 25 productions for <b>Apple Hill Playhouse</b> including <i>Prisoner of Second Avenue</i> and <i>Squabbles</i> last summer. Other favorites are <i>On Golden Pond, The Last</i> <i>Romance, A Bench in the Sun, 6 Dance Lessons in 6 Weeks, The Odd Couple,</i> <i>Female Version, </i>and <i>The Prime of Miss Jean Brodie.</i> She also has performed for <b>Little Lake Theatre</b>, <b>St Vincent Summer Theatre</b>, <b>City Theatre</b>, and <b>Greensburg Civic Theatre</b>. Special thanks to Pat, Marge, my husband, my children, dear family and friends for their continuous encouragement and support.</p>
