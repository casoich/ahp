Everyone was happy because they were trying to make everyone else happy, except the princess. She wasn't happy because all she could think about was herself. A visiting prince isn't happy because he wants to slay a dragon and there aren't any around. The stage manager steps into this situation with a dragon tail which he waves from behind a bush. Then the princess, moved by strange emotions, does something extremely unselfish. And everyone finds happiness. What more can we ask for?
