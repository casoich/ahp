      <div class="body">
Meet Henry A Perkins, a mild mannered C.P.A. who accidently picks up the wrong 
briefcase and finds it full of money.  Assuming that it is illicit, Henry 
decides to keep the money and move with his confused wife to Barcelona.  They 
wait for a cab and the doorbell rings.  Henryâ€™s attempts to extricate himself 
from the charges brought against him by two detectives lead to increasing 
hysterical situations.    </div>
