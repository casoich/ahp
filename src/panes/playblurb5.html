      <div class="body">John, an irascible Scotsman and Maude, an uptight English lady, meet when John’s ward marries Maude’s niece.  When the young couple adopt an infant, John and Maude, who despise one another, are forced into traveling 6000 miles to pick up the baby.  Stranded in San Francisco for several weeks, the midlife couple must care for the child.  In the process, they form a new partnership and learn some lessons about life and love.</div>
