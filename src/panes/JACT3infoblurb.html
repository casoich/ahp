    As his castle literally falls apart around him, the Emperor spends every cent in his domain on clothes. His wife, children, and servants run ragged while he is overdressed to the teeth. Meanwhile Sir Yesir and his lady are plotting the downfall of the Emperor. Into this chaotic world come Snip and Tuck, a pair of crafty ne'er-do-wells, who invent a scheme to fool the castle inhabitants, most particularly the Emperor, and gain Snip and Tuck lots and lots of gold. Fall down funny!
