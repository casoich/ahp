She wants to "pair-up" her widowed mother, <b>Milaminia</b>, who never stops talking, with the local woodsman, <b>Anxious Evermum</b>, who is too shy to speak up. When Rose goes off to visit Granny (the only one who will listen to her), she loses her glasses (a common occurence), and does not see her first encounter in the woods is with a frustrated <b>Wolf</b> who is looking to keep up the family tradition of "gobbling up" a tasty victim. songs include <i>Don't Take the Shortcut</i>, <i>Something's Wrong Here</i>, <i>Little Red Cape with a Hood</i>, <i>Ask What I'd Wish For</i>, <i>Pack The Basket</i>, and <i>I'm not Feeling Well, Today</i>. Weeks after the show, kids will still be singing "Don't Take The Shortcut!"
