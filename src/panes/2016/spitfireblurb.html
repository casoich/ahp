    A mix of country, bluegrass, and Broadway styled pop ballads, Spitfire Grill is as charming as a warm winter blanket.  The heartfelt lyrics and infectious melodies provide a soul satisfying work: a compelling story that flows with grace and the rush of anticipation, characters who have many dimensions, transformations that are plausible and moving.  The musical is freeing -penetrated by honesty, it glows.
