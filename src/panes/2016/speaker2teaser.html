                    Michael Rozell will lead a sharing session for anyone interested in high school theater productions.  He will discuss his funding situation at Belle Vernon Area High School and how he has built a huge spending account and has become self sustaining, needing little financial support from the district.  Once he gives his background, the group will be open to discuss anything related to their individual situations so that we may help to problem solve or walk away with a different way of approaching something.  The group can discuss costumes, props and set pieces that they currently have and are willing to share with each other.  The purpose of this session is to simply build upon what is already a strong community of high school plays and musicals in the Westmoreland and Allegheny County area.
