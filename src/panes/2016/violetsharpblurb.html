    Based on the true story of the 1932 Lindberg kidnapping, the play is named for 
    the young British maid working in the home of Anne Lindberghâ€™s mother.  Violet 
    raises the suspicion of Investigator Walsh with contradictory testimony regarding 
    her whereabouts at the time of the kidnapping.  Under pressure from her own 
    demons as well as the police, Violet is helpless to clear her name and the growing 
    reputation of guilt.  Riveting! <i>Directed by Karin Maresh. "Looks beyond the 
    sensationalism of the kidnapping to focus on one of the other casualties."</i>
