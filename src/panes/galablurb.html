                Please join us for an evening of entertainment and fellowship as we celebrate the legacy of Apple Hill Playhouse and ensure the future of the theatrical center that has brought joy to so many in our community for the past half-century.  The event will include performances by many Apple Hill regulars from the present and past, as well as a gift basket raffle, drinks and hors d’oeuvres, and even a photo booth!
