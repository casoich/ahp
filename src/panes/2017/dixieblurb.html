    A story of five unforgettable women whose friendships began many years ago on 
    their college swim team who set aside a long weekend every August at the same 
    beach cottage on the Outer Banks to catch up, laugh and meddle in each otherâ€™s 
    lives.  The play focuses on four of those meetings over a thirty year expanse.  
    As their lives unfold and the years pass, the five increasingly rely on one 
    another to get through all the challenges life throws at them.  A hilarious 
    and touching comedy about friendships that last forever.
