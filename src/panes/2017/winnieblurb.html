    A very special Friend-and-Relation tells Christopher Robin a story of a day 
    long ago (about last year) when Eeyore, the old gray donkey who lives by himself 
    in the thistle corner of Hundred Acre Wood, was absolutely miserable.  He had 
    lost his tail and Winnie-the-Pooh and Piglet got all of their friends and a 
    search was organized.  There is a great deal of fun and excitement, plus delightful 
    songs, in the adventure that follows.  Its theme, which concerns caring, sharing 
    and the importance of cultivating friends, makes this a very special and enduring 
    musical for all.
