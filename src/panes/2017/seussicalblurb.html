    One of the most performed shows in America, Seussical is a fantastical, magical, 
    musical extravaganza. Bringing together all of our favorite Dr. Seuss characters, 
    the show transports us from the Jungle of Not to the Circus of McGurkus to the 
    Invisible world of the Whos.  The Cat in the Hat tells the story of Horton, 
    an elephant who discovers a speck of dust that contains the Whos, including 
    Jojo, a Whochild sent off to military school for thinking too many “thinks.”  
    Horton must not only protect the Whos from a world of naysayers and dangers, 
    but he must guard an egg abandoned by the irresponsible Mayzie La Bird.  Horton 
    faces ridicule, kidnapping and a trial.  Ultimately, the powers of friendship, 
    loyalty, family and community are challenged and emerge triumphant.

    Seussical is fun for the WHOLE family!
